# budgetBuddy
Budget Buddy (or BudBud) is an android budgeting app equipped with features including: 
    recycler view, graph and percentage breakdowns, animations, and a splash screen.

This is one of the first applications I have ever made, so it is far from perfect, but I am proud of the progress I have made since I started!

I hope this app can help someone in some way, either as a model for a project/homework, or for its intended use - budgeting!
